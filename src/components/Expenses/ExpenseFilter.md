Assignment 2: Time to Practice: Working with Events & State

Step 1 - Add a new component 'ExpenseFilter.js' and import the JS code
Step 2 - Import CSS 'ExpenseFilter.css'
Step 3 - Listen the changes to the 'ExpenseFilter' dropdown event, when users choose a State (year)
Step 4 - Store the value of this event in State, and return to the 'Expense' component
Step 5 - Add 'ExpenseFilter' component into 'Expense' component

Important:
We do not use useState() for ExpenseFilter.js because we only need to pass data from child to parent.
But we do not update the displaying data in 'ExpenseFilter' component.
This is not the same with the 'click' button that will change item name from 'Toilet Paper' to 'New Item'.

Additional Key Point:
Think about where should we add the useState(), where to update the value, and when should we pass it.
